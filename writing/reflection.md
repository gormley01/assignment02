## What is the reference of the article you choose?

[Game Development in Godot Engine](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/746943)

## Explain why this article is meaningful to your work.

The author details the creation of an interactive user interface, giving the user freedom of control, explaining how exploration and item collection could work and illustrate how a game could procedurally generate levels based on set parameters.

Besides this, the paper also details how physics, graphics processing, scripting, animations, audio and even how one would go about adding online functionality to their desired game.

I believe that this paper could assist me greatly when attempting to create a 2D game in the Godot Engine. I believe that the information contained within this paper detailing the possible struggles as well as tutorials explaining how the engine is used will be very beneficial for when I go about creating a game in the Godot engine for the first time.
